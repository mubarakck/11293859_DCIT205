What I have learnt from the project.

This project has made it know to me the importance of planning and preparation. Before creating a website, you need adequate resources such as videos pictures, links and general information about the subject your website will be about. This help increase the functionality of your website because your websites goals will be better achieved when you prepare beforehand and plan accordingly thus appealing to your target audience. 

The creation of this project also made it known to me that I have a lot more to learn under HTML JAVASCRIPT & CSS and that a web developers greatest help is reference from the internet as well as other personnel in the field who are experienced.
In the nut-shell, this project has given me some valuable insights that creating an effective website requires adequate planning, design, technical skills and continuous improvement.
